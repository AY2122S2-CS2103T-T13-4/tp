### Project: ModuleMateFinder

ModuleMateFinder is a desktop address-book-like application used to keep track of your friends' contacts, as well as 
the modules they are taking. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is 
written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add comments to a person.
  * What it does: Allows the user to add a comment to a specified `Person` in ModuleMateFinder.
  * Justification: Allows user to give a reason why they blacklisted or favourite somebody.
  * Highlights: This feature required an understanding of how to add a new command and field to the project.
  * Credits: This feature was adapted from the Remark tutorial.

* **New Feature**: Added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.
